# TakeawayChallengeJS


* There are two classes. Menu and takeaway class.
* All the test passes for the menu class.
* There are two tests in the takeaway class that are failing.
* Fot the 'shows sum of orders' test my expected value is 6, however it recieved 4. I'm not sure how to adjust the code.
* for the 'print all orders with price' test the expected value is "You ordered Pizza: Â£4" however the valuse recieved was ["Pizza,4", "Chicken,2"]. 

* Any guidence to rectify the code will be much appreciated.
